// we need HTML routes for get notes.
// GET * should return the index.html file


// need API routes 
// GET /api/notes should read the db.json file and return all saved notes as JSON
// POST /api/notes should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the db.json file, and then return the new note to the client. 

// You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).
